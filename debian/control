Description: FileSystem Abstraction System for Go
 Afero is a filesystem framework providing a simple, uniform and universal
 API interacting with any filesystem, as an abstraction layer providing
 interfaces, types and methods. Afero has an exceptionally clean interface
 and simple design without needless constructors or initialization methods.
 .
 Afero is also a library providing a base set of interoperable backend
 filesystems that make it easy to work with afero while retaining all the
 power and benefit of the os and ioutil packages.
 .
 Afero provides significant improvements over using the os package alone,
 most notably the ability to create mock and testing filesystems without
 relying on the disk.
 .
 It is suitable for use in any situation where you would consider using
 the OS package as it provides an additional abstraction that makes it
 easy to use a memory-backed filesystem during testing.  It also adds
 support for the http filesystem for full interoperability.
